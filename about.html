    <section class="about">  
        <h2 class="about-me">I go by the name Diona. I completed my Bachelors in Electronics Engineering.I've been working on things I'm passionate about.
        I started my career as an Implementation Engineer, wherein I configure products according to client requirementmets and testing the same. Then I was working as a Quality Engineer with a startup wherein I got to explore websites and come up with testing strategies and techniques. Thats when I realized I need to learn more in depth on Web Development and now I'm a Full Stack Developer graduate from General Assembly.I believe in hardwork, learning, and determination. I only do what I enjoy and I have to say I'm lucky to be working on things I truly care about thus far.
