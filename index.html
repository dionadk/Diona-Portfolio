        Hello!My name is Diona Kurien, and I'm a graduate of General Assembly's Web Development Bootcamp.
     believe in hardwork, learning, and determination. I like to read, from personal development books, to startup stories, to interesting fictions (once in awhile to mix it up). I never understood the power of books until I started working at 22 years old when I realized there are so much knowledge out there! Being able to absorb them and apply to your own life is amazing. Another concept I live by is the 24-hour split - You have 24 hours a day, you spend 8 hours at work, and you spend 8 hours sleeping. The remaining 8 hours determine what kind of life you live. This changes my view on my daily routine.<br />
